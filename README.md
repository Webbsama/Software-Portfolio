# Overview for Software Portfolio

I am Samantha Webb. I am a senior at BYUI. 

My goal for these projects is to push myself in my learning, understanding, and application of software. Now that I am senior in my final year of college, I am really understanding that I have more to learn. I do believe that my projects speak for themselves. I have put a lot of time and effort into them. I have challenged myself in creating them.
